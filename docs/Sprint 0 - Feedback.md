## Planning Document Feedback (Group): 

- Great system description! You should be able to use that with very few modifications for your Rhodes Symposium abstract.
- Great list of the basic features.
- Great architectural overview and system diagram.
- Your epics are generally very good, though I have questions about 'in- app environment'. It seems more like a non- functional requirement. I also doubt that you want to process payments directly in the app. Something to talk about more in class.
- Your non-functional requirements are also great, though you may want to relax the performance requirements a bit. I think 2000 simultaneous users is at least an order of magnitude greater than the number of users you would get at a peak time.
- Your technologies list looks reasonable, but OneLogin may be overly ambitious. I have a meeting with Stacy Pennington to discuss this more on Wednesday. I'll update you after that meeting.
- Your MVP is great. It looks very well thought out.
- Your roadmap is also great. The only suggestion I have is to indicate that the MVP would be completed in Sprint 5. I was able to figure this out from the earlier listing, but it would have been nice to see it mentioned directly.
- Amazing job on your plan! I am really impressed.

## Requirements Feedback (Group): 

- User stories generally look great.
- Titles are consistently formatted.
- All user stories are clearly traceable to epics.
- I'm only seeing acceptance criteria on a single card (for US1). I'd highly recommend you try to add info on how to verify that your user stories were completed properly.
- Not seeing any estimation details on your cards. Something you should consider discussing and adding. Numbers (1,2,3,5,8..) or 'small' 'medium' 'large' 'extra large' indicators will help you plan and divide up your work.
- Your user stories look like they are prioritized well, and the ordering matches up with your roadmap!
- Overall, good job. You are missing a few things, but your Kanban board shows solid work.
